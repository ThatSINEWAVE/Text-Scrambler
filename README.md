A simple web app that encodes and decodes text using a custom scrambling method based on a decoding word. This app is built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** and features a modern dark-themed user interface.

## Features
- **Encode Text**: Scramble your input text using a decoding word.
- **Decode Text**: Reverse the encoding process using the same decoding word.
- **User-Friendly UI**: A responsive, professional dark theme for a clean and intuitive experience.
- **Lightweight**: No external libraries or frameworks required.


## How It Works
1. Enter the text you want to encode or decode in the input field.
2. Provide a decoding word (can be a word, number, or any string).
3. Click "Encode" to scramble the text or "Decode" to unscramble it.
4. The result will appear in the output field.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ThatSINEWAVE/Text-Scrambler.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Usage
- **Encoding**: Scrambles the input text by shifting character codes based on the length of the decoding word.
- **Decoding**: Reverses the scrambling process to restore the original text.

## Customization
Feel free to modify the CSS and JavaScript files to adjust the appearance or scrambling logic to fit your needs.
