# Text Scrambler

A simple web app that encodes and decodes text using a custom scrambling method based on a decoding word. This app is built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** and features a modern dark-themed user interface.

## Features
- **Encode Text**: Scramble your input text using a decoding word.
- **Decode Text**: Reverse the encoding process using the same decoding word.
- **User-Friendly UI**: A responsive, professional dark theme for a clean and intuitive experience.
- **Lightweight**: No external libraries or frameworks required.


## How It Works
1. Enter the text you want to encode or decode in the input field.
2. Provide a decoding word (can be a word, number, or any string).
3. Click "Encode" to scramble the text or "Decode" to unscramble it.
4. The result will appear in the output field.
